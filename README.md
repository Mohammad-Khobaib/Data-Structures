# Data Structures Practice Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures Practice Repository!

This repository is created for practicing the implementation of various data structures in programming and gaining a deeper understanding of data structures.

## Overview

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a platform for learning and practicing data structures through hands-on implementation. Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science and software development, and understanding them is essential for writing efficient and robust code.

## Purpose

- **Implementation Practice**: Practice implementing different data structures in C++ programming language.
- **Understanding Depth**: Gain a deeper understanding of data structures by implementing them from scratch and analyzing their behavior and performance.
- **Problem Solving**: Enhance problem-solving skills by solving exercises and challenges related to data structures.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have implemented a data structure in a programming language or have solved a problem related to data structures, feel free to contribute by submitting a pull request.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the implementation of the data structure you want to work with. For example, if you want to work with the `array` data structure, change your directory to the `array` directory:
   ```
   cd array
   ```

3. Once you're in the appropriate directory, compile the test file associated with the data structure. For example, to compile the `array_test.cpp` file, run the following command:
   ```
   g++ array_test.cpp -o array_test
   ```

4. After compiling the test file, execute the generated executable to run the test cases:
   ```
   ./array_test
   ```

5. You'll see the output of the test cases in the terminal, indicating whether they pass or fail. Use this feedback to debug and improve your implementation.

By following these steps, you can easily navigate to the directory containing the implementation of the data structure you want to work with and compile the associated test file to run the test cases.
